This is was the most difficult project I've had to work through for this course, even the final product is something I'm not that proud of but I lost my patience with it. Unlike most of the other README in my other repositories this one was written after the doing the project (the others are written while working on the project). I ended with a piece of code that would randomly place the images from the image folder 30 times and after it does that it will continue to do that but this time the images all have some type of filter on them which will eventually cause them to lose their orignal image and become squares of colours. This was difficult because my orignal idea was to have a filter over the entire canvas and have the images randomly spawn but trying to figure that out was too difficult so moved on to trying to make the images have filters that would change colour however while working on this I read the task again and started to think that I didn't understand what the task was. So in the end, I tried to mix and mash the functions that were shown in the workshop video. I played with the frame rate a bit, originally it was set at 60 but changed it to 20 because I felt that 60 was too fast for people to see what the original images were so I set it to 20 so people have time to see the original images.
